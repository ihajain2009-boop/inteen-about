              InTeen is a non-profit organisation dedicated to providing meaningful internship opportunities to high school students across India. In a country where academic achievement often dominates focus, real-world exposure can be rare. We bridge that gap by connecting motivated teens with companies and startups ready to mentor and include them — creating pathways for practical learning, confidence, and career clarity.

              InTeen wasn’t built in a boardroom. It grew out of conversations, frustrations, and the shared feeling that teenagers deserve more than just academic pressure — they deserve opportunities, mentorship, and a space where their ambitions are actually taken seriously.
              <br /><br />
              As high-school students ourselves, we know what it feels like to want to explore beyond academics but not know where to begin. That confusion, that curiosity, and that drive inspired us to create InTeen — a platform that supports you, guides you, and grows with you.
              <br /><br />
              Thank you for believing in this journey with us. We’re building InTeen for you, but also with you, and we’ll keep shaping it into a space that truly empowers every teen who joins us.
